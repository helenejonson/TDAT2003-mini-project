# Mini Project

This project is heavily influenced by the group tasks this semester and it can be a possibility that some of the methods are the same. 

The bootstrap examples have been used as a start and have been tweaked for own use 

The tikker bar is use of the code on the page linked bellow and modified from there

Parts of code and methods are copied from lectures and example code that we got access to during tasks earlier in the semester.
